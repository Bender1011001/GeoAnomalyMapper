INTERPRETATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Detection criteria:
- Mean anomaly must exceed ±0.50σ within the sampling buffer.
- The anomaly sign must match the expected behaviour of the feature class.
- At least 25 valid pixels are required for a conclusive result.

Use the success rate as a coarse indication of how consistently the fused raster
captures known targets. Investigate locations flagged as incorrect or
insufficient data to understand whether additional preprocessing or data layers
are necessary.

NOTES:
- Values are expressed in standard deviation (σ) units relative to the regional mean.
- Buffers are applied in degrees converted from the requested kilometre radius.
