======================================================================

INTERPRETATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A successful detection means the measured anomaly matches the expected signature:
- Caves/voids/karst: Should show NEGATIVE anomalies (< -0.3σ)
- Dense structures/ores: Should show POSITIVE anomalies (> +0.3σ)

Success rate of 21.4% indicates the fusion pipeline is
needs improvement at detecting known subsurface features.

NOTES:
- Values in sigma (σ) units = standard deviations from regional mean
- 2km buffer used for spatial averaging
- Threshold: |0.3σ| for detection significance
