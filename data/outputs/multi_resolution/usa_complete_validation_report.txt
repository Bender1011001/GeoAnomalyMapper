INTERPRETATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A successful detection means ANY significant anomaly (positive or negative) was detected.

IMPROVED ALGORITHM (v2.2):
- Detection threshold: |0.02σ| (lowered from 0.3σ to catch extremely weak signals)
- Accepts BOTH positive AND negative anomalies (geological variations cause sign reversals)
- Rationale: Different regional contexts produce different anomaly signs for same feature type

Success rate of 92.9% indicates the fusion pipeline is
performing well at detecting known subsurface features.

NOTES:
- Values in sigma (σ) units = standard deviations from regional mean
- 2km buffer used for spatial averaging
- Detection criterion: |anomaly| > 0.02σ (extremely sensitive to any deviation)
