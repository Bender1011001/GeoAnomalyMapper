        The project started in 2003 and resulted in a first version of the map (Korhonen et al., 2007). A call for candidates initiated in 2010 led to the building of a new map which, after evaluation and correction, was released at the IUGG General Assembly of Prag in June 2015 as WDMAM version 2.0. An improved version, built with the same methodology and additional data, was released at the IUGG General Assembly of Berlin in 2023 as WDMAM version 2.1. This web site aims to distribute freely and as widely as possible a provisional version of the map (in jpeg format), the full grid or parts of the grid (in ASCII) to interested scientists and the general public. A printed version of the version 2.1 may be released by CGMW in a near future. A paper describing the building of the version 2.0 was published (Lesur et al., EPS, 2016).
