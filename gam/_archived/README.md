# Archived Engines

This folder contains archived components removed as part of Phase 1 â€” Project Reset and Foundation.

- Archive action: engines directory archived to a date-stamped folder.
- Archived from: GeoAnomalyMapper/gam/engines
- Archived to: GeoAnomalyMapper/gam/_archived/engines_20251003
- Archived on: 2025-10-03 (local system date)

Rationale:
- The engines modules have been archived to reduce surface area and simplify the codebase in accordance with the Phase 1 consolidation plan. Future phases may reintroduce selected components with improved interfaces and testing.

Notes:
- If the engines directory did not exist at the time of archiving, no move occurred. The _archived directory is retained to document this status and to serve as the standard location for future archival actions.
