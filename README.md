## Project Overview

GeoAnomalyMapper (GAM) is an open-source Python toolkit designed for fusing publicly available geophysical datasets—including gravity, magnetic, seismic, and InSAR—to detect and map deep subsurface anomalies on a global scale. GAM leverages advanced data fusion and inversion techniques to construct probabilistic 3D subsurface models, starting from coarse resolutions and iteratively refining them as more data modalities are integrated.

The core purpose of GAM is to democratize access to geophysical anomaly detection, enabling users to identify potential underground features such as voids, faults, mineral deposits, or archaeological structures without requiring expensive proprietary surveys. Key capabilities include:

- Automated ingestion from global public data sources (e.g., USGS, IRIS, ESA).
- Multi-modal data fusion using Bayesian methods for robust anomaly scoring.
- Scalable processing from local regions to global coverage via parallel tiling.
- Rich visualization and export options for 2D/3D maps and reports.

GAM is particularly valuable for:
- **Archaeological Research**: Detecting hidden chambers or structures (e.g., beneath the Giza Pyramids).
- **Resource Exploration**: Identifying potential hydrocarbon reservoirs or mineral deposits.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Mapping geological hazards like subsidence or fault lines.
- **Academic and Scientific Analysis**: Providing reproducible workflows for geophysical studies.

For a detailed system architecture, refer to the [Architecture Documentation](docs/architecture.md).

## Key Features and Benefits

- **Multi-Modal Data Fusion**: Seamlessly integrate gravity, magnetic, seismic, and InSAR data for comprehensive subsurface analysis, reducing false positives through joint inversion.
- **Global Scalability**: Process entire continents or the globe using Dask-based parallel tiling, with efficient memory management for large datasets.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Command-line (CLI) tools, Python API, and Jupyter notebooks for flexible usage across skill levels.
- **Extensible Design**: Plugin system for adding new data sources, inversion algorithms, and visualization formats.
- **Robust Performance**: Comprehensive testing (95%+ coverage), CI/CD integration, and performance benchmarks for reliable results.
- **Open Science Focus**: All code, data pipelines, and outputs are designed for reproducibility and collaboration.

Benefits include cost savings (no proprietary data needed), accelerated discovery in geosciences, and community-driven improvements through open-source contributions.

## Installation Instructions

GAM supports multiple installation methods tailored to different user types. We recommend Python 3.10+ and a virtual environment.

### For End-Users (Quick Setup via PyPI)

Ideal for researchers or analysts running pre-built analyses.

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv gam_env
   source gam_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: gam_env\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install via pip:
   ```bash
   pip install geoanomalymapper
   ```

3. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   gam --version
   ```

### For Developers and Contributors (From Source)

For those modifying code or extending functionality.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourorg/GeoAnomalyMapper.git
   cd GeoAnomalyMapper
   ```

2. Set up environment (Conda recommended for geospatial deps):
   ```bash
   conda create -n gam-dev python=3.12
   conda activate gam-dev
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # Includes testing tools
   ```

3. Install in editable mode:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

### For Researchers (Conda Environment with Full Dependencies)

For heavy geospatial processing.

1. Install Miniconda if needed, then:
   ```bash
   conda create -n gam-research -c conda-forge python=3.12 gdal obspy simpeg
   conda activate gam-research
   pip install geoanomalymapper
   ```

**System Requirements**:
- **OS**: Linux/macOS (preferred); Windows via WSL.
- **Hardware**: 16GB+ RAM, multi-core CPU; GPU optional for advanced inversions.
- **Storage**: 100GB+ for global data (use external drives or cloud caching).
- **Dependencies**: See [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for full list. Common issues: GDAL (use `conda install -c conda-forge gdal` if pip fails).

For troubleshooting, see [Installation Guide](docs/user/installation.md).

## Quick Start Guide

Get started with GAM in minutes.

### Basic CLI Usage (Giza Pyramids Example)

1. Configure your run (optional; defaults work for small regions):
   Edit [config.yaml](config.yaml) or use CLI flags.

2. Run analysis:
   ```bash
   gam run --bbox 29.9 30.0 31.1 31.2 --modalities gravity seismic insar --output results/giza
   ```

   This fetches data, processes it, detects anomalies, and generates outputs in `results/giza/` (maps, CSVs, reports).

3. View results:
   - Open `results/giza/anomaly_map.png` for a 2D visualization.
   - Explore `results/giza/anomalies.csv` for detected features.

### Python API Example

```python
import yaml
from gam.core.pipeline import run_pipeline
from gam.visualization.manager import generate_visualization

# Load configuration
with open('config.yaml', 'r') as f:
    config = yaml.safe_load(f)

# Run pipeline
bbox = config['data']['bbox']  # e.g., (29.9, 30.0, 31.1, 31.2)
results = run_pipeline(
    bbox=bbox,
    modalities=['gravity', 'seismic'],
    output_dir='results/giza'
)

# Generate visualization
fig = generate_visualization(results['anomalies'], type='2d_map')
fig.savefig('giza_anomaly_map.png')
```

For interactive tutorials, see [Quickstart Notebook](docs/tutorials/01_basic_analysis.ipynb).

### Global Processing

For worldwide analysis:
```bash
gam run --global --modalities all --tile-size 10 --parallel-workers 8 --output global_results/
```

This tiles the Earth into 10° chunks and processes in parallel.

For more examples, see [User Guide](docs/user/user_guide.md) and [Tutorials](docs/tutorials/).
