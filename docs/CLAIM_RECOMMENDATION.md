# Claim Recommendation Report

## Executive Summary
Based on the advanced 5-factor scoring model, we have identified **5 Primes Targets** that represent the best opportunity for filing a mining claim. These targets were selected for:
1.  **High Confidence Score (>80)**: Strong signal strength + proximity to proven mines.
2.  **Strategic Commodity Potential**: High likelihood of Gold (Au) or Rare Earth Elements (REE).
3.  ** Accessibility**: Located on land that appears to be claimable (based on lack of active mine operations in the immediate pixel).

## Top 5 "Prime" Targets

### 1. The "Golden Anomaly" (Target #12)
*   **Confidence Score**: **88.5 / 100**
*   **Location**: Lat `35.542`, Lon `-115.485` (Approx)
*   **Why it's #1**:
    *   **Nearby**: Located 2.5km from the "Mountain Pass Mine" (World-class REE deposit).
    *   **Signal**: Extremely high gravity anomaly suggests a deep, dense intrusive body similar to the main carbonatite.
    *   **Potential**: Rare Earths (Bastnaesite), Gold.
*   **Action**: This is the "Crown Jewel". Verify land status immediately on LR2000/MLRS system.

### 2. The "Sulfide Extension" (Target #45)
*   **Confidence Score**: **82.0 / 100**
*   **Location**: Lat `35.491`, Lon `-115.520` (Approx)
*   **Why it's #2**:
    *   **Nearby**: On trend with a historic "Past Producer" of Gold/Copper.
    *   **Signal**: Linear anomaly suggests a vein or shear zone extension.
    *   **Potential**: High-grade Gold vein.
*   **Action**: Good candidate for a small claim block (lode claims).

### 3. The "Deep Stock" (Target #08)
*   **Confidence Score**: **79.5 / 100**
*   **Location**: Lat `35.510`, Lon `-115.450` (Approx)
*   **Why it's #3**:
    *   **Nearby**: Isolated from main workings but strong density contrast.
    *   **Potential**: "Blind" porphyry target (buried deposit).
    *   **Action**: Higher risk, higher reward.

### 4. Target #22 (Strategic)
*   **Confidence Score**: 76.0
*   **Potential**: Silver/Lead/Zinc.
*   **Note**: Near old tailings. Ensure you are not claiming over valid existing claims.

### 5. Target #03 (Speculative)
*   **Confidence Score**: 74.5
*   **Potential**: Lithium (Pegmatite potential).

## How to File a Claim (Quick Guide)
1.  **Check Land Status**: Use the BLM MLRS (Mineral & Land Records System) map to ensure the land is **OPEN** and not already claimed.
2.  **Stake It**: Go to the localized point. Erect a "Location Monument" (4x4 post or stone cairn) with a "Notice of Location" paper inside.
3.  **File**:
    *   Record with the **County Recorder** (San Bernardino County) within 90 days ($15-$50).
    *   File with the **BLM State Office** within 90 days (~$225 per 20 acres).

> This data is probabilistic. **Ground truthing is required.** Do not spend money on filing fees until you have physically visited the site and seen promising rocks.
