# Archaeological Applications

## Overview

GAM is ideal for non-invasive archaeological surveys, detecting buried structures via gravity voids and InSAR subsidence. Applications include site prospection and heritage preservation.

**Key Benefits**:
- High-resolution anomaly mapping without excavation.
- Global applicability for ancient sites.
- Integration with ground-penetrating radar data.

## Case Study: Giza Pyramids (Egypt)

### Background
The Giza plateau hosts the Great Pyramids. GAM detects potential undiscovered chambers using gravity (low-density voids) and InSAR (micro-subsidence).

### Data and Setup
- **Bbox**: [29.95, 30.05, 31.10, 31.20] (Pyramid complex).
- **Modalities**: Gravity, InSAR.
- **Config Snippet**:
  ```yaml
